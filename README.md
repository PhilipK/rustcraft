Welcome to RUSTCRAFT!
Rustcraft is a simple Minecraft engine written in rust using [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs).

## But Why?

You may ask yourself why does this exist? I wanted to work on a project to learn more about [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs) as well as practice my Rust skills. I then randomly saw this youtube [video](https://youtu.be/4O0_-1NaWnY) and got inspired to try to make a simple Minecraft engine in Rust!

## Inspiration

As I explained I was inspired by this [video](https://youtu.be/4O0_-1NaWnY) and the corresponding [codebase](https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend). This is why you will probably see a lot of design similarities between my project and [this](https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend) one. [Jdah](https://github.com/jdah), your video was awesome. (I also copied his blocks atlas because I liked it a lot).

## Current State

I am pretty happy with the current state of the engine. There are a few problems with it but they are outside of my MVP scope. I am aware that the game is not as efficient and smooth as it should be. I initially set as a goal to not use any threading or unsafe rust. I did end up eventually using [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) (but I should really be using [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)). This would require some not trivial redesign and maybe I will update this in the future ðŸ¤·.

## Potential Updates

- [] Transparent water
- [] Lighting (real sun or "hacked" lighting)
- [] Block memory map (saves location of broken/placed blocks)
- [] Game physics
- [] additional sprites: (tree, flowers)
- [] Block selection during placement
- [] Biomes
- [] "Real" concurency for chunk generation (Tokio).

## Prerequisites
